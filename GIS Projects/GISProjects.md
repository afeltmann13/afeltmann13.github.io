### Arkansas Freshwater Explorer
Arkansas Freshwater Explorer is an application used by the Water Planning Branch within the Division of Environmental Quality of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment. Its primary function is to provide the public information regarding the sampling activities of the Water Planning Branch. This application was originally built using ArcGIS Online's Map Viewer (now deprecated). I rebuilt it using the newer Web Application Builder. These data are stored as a mapserver from a local REST API and brought into the Application. This application is designed to be public-facing and easy to use for someone with limited GIS knowledge.
